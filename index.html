            <p>Money is not the only commodity that is fun to give. We can give time, we can give ourexpertise, we can
                give our love,or
                simply give a smile. What does that cost? The point is, none of us can ever run out of something
                worthwhile to give.</p>

                <p>Poor people do not have enough clothing, food, education and healthcare. Being poor means deprived
                    economically,
                    politically and socially. They hardly get opportunities.</p>

                <h1>Shekter For Family</h1>
                <p>There are people who live their life lavishly. They are not only enjoying the joy of essentials but
                    also have
                    what they
                    want and desire; a luxurious living providing them an extra comfort.</p>

                <p>Imparting knowledge can help the poor and needy to stand on their feet. Education is the beginning of
                    getting out
